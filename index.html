      <h3>Virtual Private Network [CPRE230 Final Project]</h3>
      <p>This project was part of a semester long project for CPRE230 at Iowa State. 
        During the class, we created a virtual network through ISELAB (Iowa State's Virtual Server). Using Linux, HTML, and Java in different OS Software such as Kali and Ubuntu, we created
        virtual machines that handled a certain component of the virtual network.

        <h3>2048 Puzzle Game [CS227] </h3>
        <p>
          2048 Was a project I worked on while taking CS227 at Iowa State. Using back-end development
          skills, I implemented classes that would construct the core components of the game. Using Java knowledge and components such as
          arrays, loops, and lists, I was able to make these classes work together to create a working 2048 type game.

          <h3>Dungeon Crawler [CS127] </h3>
          <p>
           Dungeon Crawler was a game I designed while taking CS127 at Iowa State University.
           Created code that implements python language through inputs and functions to progress through the game. In order to 
           win the game, you must find the hidden room with all the gold.
